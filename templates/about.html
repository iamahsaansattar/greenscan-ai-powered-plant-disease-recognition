        <h2 class="about-title">About GreenScan</h2>

        <div class="about-content">

            <p>
                <strong>GreenScan</strong> is an AI-powered, web-based plant disease detection platform designed to help
                <span class="highlight-text">farmers, gardeners, and agriculture enthusiasts</span> quickly identify plant diseases using images.
                By simply uploading a photo of a plant leaf, users receive instant disease detection along with
                actionable treatment recommendations.
            </p>

            <h3>Who GreenScan Is For</h3>
            <p>
                GreenScan is built for a wide range of users, including small-scale and large-scale farmers,
                home gardeners, agriculture students, and researchers. It is especially valuable for users
                who lack access to agricultural experts but need reliable, easy-to-understand plant health insights.
            </p>

            <h3>Supported Plants & Diseases</h3>
            <p>
                GreenScan leverages a pre-trained deep learning model based on the
                <strong>PlantVillage dataset</strong>, which contains thousands of labeled images across multiple crops.
                The system currently supports diseases affecting plants such as
                <strong>Apple, Corn, Grape, Potato, Tomato, Pepper, Soybean, Strawberry</strong>, and more.
            </p>

            <h3>How GreenScan Works</h3>
            <p>
                Once an image is uploaded, GreenScan processes it using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
                to detect whether the plant is healthy or diseased. If a disease is identified, the system
                recommends region-specific treatments where available, or general treatment solutions as a fallback.
            </p>

            <h3>The Future of GreenScan</h3>
            <p>
                GreenScan is designed to grow. Future enhancements include expanding plant and disease coverage,
                improving treatment databases, and supporting additional regions. The long-term vision is to
                make GreenScan a reliable digital companion for sustainable farming and smarter plant care.

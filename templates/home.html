                    <p>
                        Capture a clear image of the affected plant leaf and upload it to GreenScan.
                        Make sure the image is well-lit and focused so the AI model can analyze the
                        plant accurately.

            <h2 class="about-title">About GreenScan</h2>

            <div class="about-content">

                <p>
                    <strong>GreenScan</strong> is an AI-powered, web-based plant disease detection platform designed to help
                    farmers, gardeners, and agriculture enthusiasts quickly identify plant diseases using images.
                    By simply uploading a photo of a plant leaf, users receive instant disease detection along with
                    actionable treatment recommendations.
                </p>

                <h3>Who GreenScan Is For</h3>
                <p>
                    GreenScan is built for a wide range of users, including small-scale and large-scale farmers,
                    home gardeners, agriculture students, and researchers. It is especially valuable for users
                    who lack access to agricultural experts but need reliable, easy-to-understand plant health insights.
                </p>

                <h3>Supported Plants & Diseases</h3>
                <p>
                    GreenScan leverages a pre-trained deep learning model based on the
                    <strong>PlantVillage dataset</strong>, which contains thousands of labeled images across multiple crops.
                    The system currently supports diseases affecting plants such as
                    <strong>Apple, Corn, Grape, Potato, Tomato, Pepper, Soybean, Strawberry</strong>, and more.
                </p>

                <h3>How GreenScan Works</h3>
                <p>
                    Once an image is uploaded, GreenScan processes it using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
                    to detect whether the plant is healthy or diseased. If a disease is identified, the system
                    recommends region-specific treatments where available, or general treatment solutions as a fallback.
